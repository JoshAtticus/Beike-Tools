# Beike Tools
Tools and Information on the "Beike" Allwinner V3/V3S action cameras. A lot of this applies to other Allwinner V3/V3S action cameras, however it's only tested on my Beike IMX175 sensor camera (also see findings.md in docs for something funny about the sensor)

## Why "Beike"
I don't know ask the random chinese solution design house that made them. "Beike" (贝壳) is Chinese for "Seashell"
