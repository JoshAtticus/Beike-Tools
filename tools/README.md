tools and stuff

## rom builder gui
this thing sucks it was a test, you are welcome to try it, I don't know if it fully works. I highly recommend using the scripts in the scripts folder instead.

## language editor
Upload a language file from /res/lang to edit its strings. New file must be same size or smaller as the old file, the tool automatically pads smaller versions to be the same as the existing one. Only "issue" is that no matter what file you upload it downloads as en.bin, too lazy to fix, just rename it yourself smh my head.
